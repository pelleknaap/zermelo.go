# zermelo.go
A little zermelo API wrapper, made in Go (golang).
I'll add a lot of other features in the near future but for now it only supports getting an access token with a "koppel code" and getting appointments. 

# Examples
You can find examples in the /examples folder. 

# Disclaimer
This project is not affiliated with Zermelo Software B.V in any way. It's only an api wrapper for Go.
